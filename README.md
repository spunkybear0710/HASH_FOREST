Blockchain-Based Blue Carbon Registry and MRV System
Abstract
Blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrass, and tidal marshes play a critical role in climate change mitigation by sequestering large amounts of carbon. However, current Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) systems are inefficient, slow, and prone to fraud, limiting the participation of small coastal communities in carbon markets. This document presents a blockchain-based MRV and carbon credit registry that integrates IoT, AI/ML, drones, and satellite data to provide real-time, verifiable, and transparent carbon credit issuance. The system leverages decentralized governance via DAOs, smart contracts for tokenized credits, and multilingual interfaces for inclusive community participation. The solution draws insights from CIFAR Alliance initiatives【5†tokenisation-of-forest-carbon-project-a-blockchain-based-approach-for-community-engagement.pdf】 and forest carbon tokenisation frameworks, adapting them for India’s coastal ecosystems.

Problem Statement
1.	Lack of decentralized, transparent, and verifiable MRV systems for blue carbon projects in India.
2.	Manual, expensive processes with long verification timelines (6–9 months).
3.	Limited specialization in blue carbon ecosystems, poor integration of communities.
4.	High verification losses (~30%) for small developers, fraud, and double counting.
5.	Absence of real-time monitoring and automated verification.
6.	Need for blockchain registry, tokenized carbon credits, and simple interfaces for coastal stakeholders.
